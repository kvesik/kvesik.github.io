LING 200 is a one-term introduction to phonology and phonetics. I was a graduate TA for this course, supporting the instructor during lecture activities, marking student assignments, running tutorials, and holding office hours. I also continued to expand and refine the Python script (to produce individualized random-sampled exams) developed in the previous term.
