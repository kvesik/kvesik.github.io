LING 200 is a one-term introduction to phonology and phonetics. I was a graduate TA for this course, supporting the instructor during lecture activities, marking student assignments, and holding office hours. I also developed, based on specifications developed collaboratively with the instructor, a database and Python script used to produce individualized random-sampled exams.
